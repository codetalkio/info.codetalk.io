    Some Simple Rules
</span>

1. Stick to English. There's people from around the world, and there is nothing worse/more annoying than people not talking in English.
2. Code, code, code!
3. Sharing is caring, and GitHub is neat

### Other Stuff
We've also got a GitHub organization for various projects etc (it'll grow with time), check it out at [github/codetalkio](https://github.com/codetalkio).

That's about it for now...
